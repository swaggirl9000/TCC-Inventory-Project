# TCC-Inventory-Project
Simple Inventory System made for Tokyo Coding Cub in order to track equipment use and status. 

Project is made using tkinter and openpyxl. The inventory has an interactive Graphic User Interface in which the user can enter the equipment name, status of the equipment, name of the tutor who is currently using it or has used it last, and whether or not the item is reserved. The inventory list is stored in a excel file. Items may be deleted from the inventory through the GUI. 

Theme is Forest Dark and is meant to mimic an excel file. 

TCCinvent.py: file with GUI options and excelt sheet manipulation.
